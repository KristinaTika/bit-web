            Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, which are the seeds of berries from the Coffea plant. The genus
            Coffea is native to tropical Africa (specifically having its origin in Ethiopia and Sudan) and Madagascar, the
            Comoros, Mauritius, and Réunion in the Indian Ocean.[2] The plant was exported from Africa to countries around
            the world. Coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily in the equatorial regions of the
            Americas, Southeast Asia, India, and Africa.European travelers to the Near East brought back stories of an unusual
            dark black beverage. By the 17th century, coffee had made its way to Europe and was becoming popular across the
            continent. Some people reacted to this new beverage with suspicion or fear, calling it the “bitter invention
            of Satan.” The local clergy condemned coffee when it came to Venice in 1615. The controversy was so great that
            Pope Clement VIII was asked to intervene. He decided to taste the beverage for himself before making a decision,
            and found the drink so satisfying that he gave it papal approval. Despite such controversy, coffee houses were
            quickly becoming centers of social activity and communication in the major cities of England, Austria, France,
            Germany and Holland. In England “penny universities” sprang up, so called because for the price of a penny one
            could purchase a cup of coffee and engage in stimulating conversation. Coffee began to replace the common breakfast
            drink beverages of the time — beer and wine. Those who drank coffee instead of alcohol began the day alert and
            energized, and not surprisingly, the quality of their work was greatly improved. (We like to think of this a
            precursor to the modern office coffee service.) By the mid-17th century, there were over 300 coffee houses in
            London, many of which attracted like-minded patrons, including merchants, shippers, brokers and artists. Many
            businesses grew out of these specialized coffee houses. Lloyd's of London, for example, came into existence at
            the Edward Lloyd's Coffee House.</article>
